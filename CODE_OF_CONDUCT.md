# Contributor Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We, as contributors and maintainers of **GalacticManager**, are committed to fostering an open and welcoming environment. We pledge to make participation in our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, experience level, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment include:
- Using welcoming and inclusive language
- Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
- Constructive criticism focused on the idea, not the person
- Showing empathy and kindness towards other community members

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:
- Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal attacks
- Public or private harassment
- Publishing othersâ€™ private information without explicit permission
- Any conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

## Our Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior and will take appropriate action in response to unacceptable behavior. Maintainers have the right to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, and other contributions that do not align with this Code of Conduct.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies both within project spaces and in public spaces when an individual is representing the project or its community.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by contacting the project team at **[info@galacticforge.net]**. All complaints will be reviewed and investigated, and will result in a response deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances. The project team is obligated to maintain confidentiality regarding the reporter of an incident.
